# linmath

Port of [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) by Wolfgang 'datenwolf' Draxinger &lt;code@datenwolf.net&gt; (licensed under WTFPL), from C to Go.

## Features and limitations

Several functions and types are provided:

* `Vec2`, a 2 element vector of float64 (x,y)
* `Vec3`, a 3 element vector of float64 (x,y,z)
* `Vec4`, a 4 element vector of float64 (4th component used for homogenous computations)
* `Mat4x4`, a 4 by 4 elements matrix (computations are done in column major order)
* `Quat`, a 4 element vector of float64 (x,y,z,w)

These may be useful for computer graphics programming.

## TODO

- [ ] Add tests
