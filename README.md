# linmath

Based on [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) by Wolfgang 'datenwolf' Draxinger &lt;code@datenwolf.net&gt; (DWTFYWTPL license).

THIS IS A PORT THAT IS IN PROGRESS

## Features

`linmath` the most commonly used types required for computer graphics programming:

* Vec3 -- 3 element vector of floats
* Vec4 -- 4 element vector of floats (4th component used for homogenous computations)
* Mat4x4 -- 4 by 4 elements matrix, computations are done in column major order
* Quat -- quaternion

The types are deliberately named like the types in GLSL.
